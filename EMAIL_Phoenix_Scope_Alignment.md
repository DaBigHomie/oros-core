# Email: Oros Scope Alignment

**To:** Phoenix  
**From:** Dame  
**Subject:** Oros - Quick Alignment Before We Build

Peace Phoenix,

I reviewed the technical specs, database schema, and executive summary you sent over. Really solid work — the immutable ledger design and escrow-first approach is exactly what investors want to see. This is investment-grade architecture.

Before I finalize the documentation and start building, I want to make sure we're aligned on a few things so there's no rework later.

**Quick Questions:**

1. **Fee Structure** — Your docs mention 20% on campaigns and 10-15% on tips. During our call, we discussed 3%. Which should I build for?

2. **MVP Scope** — Your specs include communities, tipping, content locking, and live shopping. For the initial sprint with the current budget, should we focus on core matching + transactions first, then add communities and tipping in Phase 2?

3. **Tipping for Free Creators** — Your docs say only paid creators (Oros+ at $19.99/mo) can receive tips. This might slow early adoption since new creators won't have income yet. Should we allow tipping for all creators in MVP and gate it later?

4. **Timeline** — Your phased roadmap shows 14 weeks. Our call discussed launching Q1 2026 with what we have. Want to confirm: are we doing a lean MVP first, then layering in the full system?

5. **Supporter Earnings** — Should boost-to-earn and share-to-earn be in MVP, or Phase 2?

**My Recommendation:**

Let's ship a focused MVP in 2-3 weeks with:
- Auth + profiles (multi-role)
- Campaigns + matching
- Wallets with proper ledger
- Basic transactions (escrow-first)

Then layer in communities, tipping, and supporter rewards in February when you have more capital.

This gets you something live to show investors while we build toward the full vision.

Let me know your thoughts. A quick 10-minute call or voice note works if easier.
