Phoenix,

Documentation is updated and pushed to GitHub. Here's what changed:

---

**New Files:**

| File | What's In It |
|------|--------------|
| `03-database-schema.md` | Escrow-first wallet + immutable ledger (investment-grade) |
| `04-launch-roadmap.md` | 5-sprint MVP plan (~122 hours) |

**Updated Files:**

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `01-executive-summary.md` | Your 7 subsystem architecture, $750B TAM |
| `02-product-requirements.md` | Multi-role system, simplified MVP scope |
| `07-technical-stack.md` | Money flow diagrams, payout logic |
| `README.md` | Platform overview, confirmed fee structure |

---

**Your Confirmed Decisions (Now in Code):**

- ✅ 20% campaign fee
- ✅ 10-15% tips (Phase 2)
- ✅ 3% OrosCard (Phase 3)
- ✅ All creators can receive tips
- ✅ Communities/tipping/supporter earnings → Phase 2
- ✅ Q1 2026 launch

---

**Engineering Principles Baked In:**

1. No event = no payout
2. Ledger is immutable
3. Money always escrowed first
4. Permissions controlled by role
5. Everything auditable

---

**Next Steps:**

1. Review the GitHub repo when you get a chance
2. Let me know if anything needs adjusting
3. Once you're good, I'll start Sprint 1 (Foundation + Auth)

We're locked and loaded.
