Part 1: The Vision and the Creative Economy

Dame: Peace, what's going on? Is now a good time?

Phoenix: Uh... hold on, let me still my side for a second. All right, here we go.

Dame: Yup. Yes, sir. How you doing?

Phoenix: I'm all right. I'm all right. I can call you back if I need to.

Dame: No, no, no. That's cool. I just stepped out. This is more important. But, yeah, man—they were reviewing everything you had going on on the site. I just wanted to really chop it up with you, see your service fees, and map out what I have going on to see if it can tie into what you have going on. I'm looking to develop a long-term working relationship.

Phoenix: Okay. All right. So, I already know about you, so I’ll give some backstory about myself. I'm Phoenix. Essentially, what I'm looking to build is a platform called Oros. It is a creative economy.

Now, what that is—I know you're familiar with Airbnb and Uber, these types of apps where it's a two-sided beneficial platform. This particular platform is for micro-influencers who are getting deals and endorsements, and for those who are getting none at all. Essentially, everybody is trying to learn how to monetize their influence or monetize whatever they do.

You have a lot of companies who are either looking for marketing or people to advertise. This app brings all of that together in one place. I need somebody to help develop the full structure of it. So far, does that make sense?

Dame: Yep, absolutely.

Phoenix: It’s really simple, though the backend work is more complex. Essentially, globally, you have creators who need the opportunity to make money and the ability to monetize themselves. Businesses need the ability to market themselves and grow, but it’s performance-based.

It’s not like a creator comes and says, "Hey, give me an endorsement upfront," like you would with LeBron James, where you don't know how it’s going to perform. Instead, if a creator is in alignment—like Tinder, where we have a match—the creator gets paid based on performance. If there's a click, they get paid. If there's a sale, they get a commission.

Then you have the supporters—the people who support the creators and share links. They get micro-commissions as well. So it’s three-sided:

Businesses: Pay out based on performance and receive sales.

Creators: Monetize across multiple assets.

Supporters: Receive payments for their engagement.

Eventually, we will scale and have our own card through SoFi (or similar). We will white-label a card so that creators get paid specifically on their card. As we continue to scale, we have a Revenue Operations system through Oros OS. That will specifically be about stopping the leakages of the sales process (issues common in Salesforce or HubSpot) so that businesses can capitalize on the revenue they’ve been missing out on.

It’s a niche state, but it starts with the creator economy, expands to the card aspect (at 100,000+ users), and moves to the business aspect with Oros OS. That’s the automated system businesses will utilize to optimize their revenue. I know that’s a lot and it sounds unorganized, but—

Dame: No, no, no. I love it. I'm listening. Keep going, bro. I'm listening to you.

Part 2: Background, Values, and Technical Feasibility

Phoenix: Essentially, I have it organized on paper—how it needs to be coded, programmed, and things like that. I know you're used to big projects, but based on calculations, the creator and influence industry is a $750 billion annual industry. I'm looking to tap into that. Even tapping into 1% makes this a billion-dollar platform.

It has to be a "cultural avatar." When creators want to make money, they’ll say, "Yo, check out this app." Businesses want to advertise upfront without having to come out of pocket until they see results. The only time they pay is when they are making money. Out of 370 million businesses globally, we only need 1% to 5% of the nationwide market to be a major company.

My goal is to eventually hold a residual percentage of the company, but I need everything to be built first. I have the corporation standpoint together and trademarked, but I need the building aspect to start the Series A. I need the MVP and everything together first.

Dame: Yeah, you definitely need that MVP together. Absolutely. What’s your timeline to get started? I’m able to provide you with a project brief and documents to help you have clarity into what you're presenting to stakeholders. I don't need much material from you initially. I can take a majority of it from this conversation and begin putting everything together.

My background allows me to efficiently provide whatever you need in a minimum amount of time at the highest quality. Financially, my goal is to help build a vision because I understand the long-term goal. I’m not just some random guy. I want to understand realistically, from a deposit perspective, what's possible and when you're trying to begin. Is it today? Tomorrow? 7 to 14 days? Do you want a summary of this conversation for clarity first?

Phoenix: First and foremost, I appreciate you. I'm grateful you’ve mastered your skillset to be in a position to help people like myself. Regarding timing, it’s based on capital. We are raising capital now. I can communicate fast and put what I'm saying into organized executive summaries.

Regarding the MVP, there is AI that can do an MVP, but I need depth to show for funding. Let me know what is needed—whether it's 10 bands or 100 bands—because I know at the highest quality, it could be $100k to $300k. I can plan accordingly. I’m looking to get things going in the first quarter of 2026.

For example, with OnlyFans—the founder borrowed 10,000 pounds ($13,000 USD). Five years later, he cashed out. That’s the type of time I want to be on. I want to build something where a whole group of people gets wealthy and changes the narrative.

Dame: So you want the consulting piece as well? I want to give you some insight so you understand how I'm different. I’m available now because I lost my entire family about three years ago. Prior to that, I had retired from the United Nations. I spent the last three years traveling the world, finding my purpose. I’ve had it all—the money, the notoriety, the fame. It humbled me.

Now, my goal is to provide services, expertise, and resources on a level that is basically impossible for anyone in our culture. I was part of the Microsoft Social Impact project. Those were my dreams and visions that they now use to make hundreds of millions of dollars.

I don't want to hinder your production or your movement toward your dream. A resource like myself doesn't come often. I’ve helped build GPT, Bard (now Gemini), Claude, Leonardo. I've been in tech for 20-something years. The problem isn't the tech. It’s you telling me what you need. We could easily knock out three or four phases before Saturday evening because I have the platform to support it.

Phoenix: That is huge. To me, that sounds more like a partner-type position. I honor you for everything you’ve been through. I low-key feel uncomfortable just saying "I need this" without knowing what I can do for you. By February, I’ll have 10 bands ($10,000) I can pay, but even that is worth way more than your expertise. I want to establish what type of partnership this is or what percentage of the company you'd want.

Dame: No, never. I’ve received much more than I deserved in my life. I don’t look at it like that at all. 10 bands when you're just starting is a lot unless you have liquid capital. Realistically, what do you need to get started?

Part 3: MVP Requirements, App Architecture, and Execution Plan

Phoenix: To get started, I need the MVP. People need to be able to go through and utilize the basic functionalities of the app—at least be able to create their profiles. We need the basic functionalities for profiles for both businesses and creators, and then build up the pipeline for a launch.

Businesses need to be organized on the backend because they will upload campaigns. If they have a campaign, they need to find an influencer to help them run it. All of that needs to be organized within the dashboard.

On top of that, our revenue model is a 3% fee from all transactions across the board. When a business pays a creator, we get a percentage. They can start for free, but we’ll also have marketed features for creators who want to learn how to leverage their influence. We can add training as a service. There will be a free version, a $20 version, and a $100 version for "Series Creators" who want to be immediately matched with higher-end companies.

Dame: Gotcha. You’ll need authentication. Do you want it connected to Gmail, Facebook, and business emails?

Phoenix: Yes, Google authentication. Regular email and password as a backup with dual-factor authentication.

Dame: When they log into this dashboard, what do they see?

Phoenix: They’ll see their account balance and possible opportunities. I’m still mapping out the exact design, and I need help with that. I want it to be psychological and gamified. It should play on the psychological aspect of wanting to evolve and make more money. They should have their messages, dual communication, and options to search partners.

I was thinking matching should be based on hashtags. If a model focuses on beauty or cars, those keywords link them with businesses holding the same keywords. Once they match, they can communicate. Creators will have a video on their profile—not just a picture. It’s a talent management platform where talent around the world can be discovered and matched with real-life opportunities.

Dame: Regarding the design for the MVP—are you looking for a mobile app or a web app? A Web App (PWA) is essentially the same thing without the extra step of going through the App Store. It’s much more cost-efficient to start. You can "Add to Home Screen" and it opens independently like an app.

Phoenix: I didn’t know that. That sounds ideal.

Dame: You mentioned gamification. Usually, that involves a feed or social interaction.

Phoenix: I'm not trying to make a social media app. When I say gamification, I mean bonuses. Like, "If you get a campaign within this amount of time, you get a reward." That reward can be cashed out. Supporters get paid per micro-click. It teaches people how to present themselves as influencers of a lifestyle rather than just selling a product.

Dame: I’m familiar with that. Are you familiar with Kalshi (K-A-L-S-H-I)? It’s a platform where you can bet on anything. It’s highly gamified. We can implement those types of reward mechanics.

Dame: Here’s how we move: we jump on a screen share throughout the process. I’ll create a development site and give you access so you can provide feedback. We can even do a "countdown" launch. It encourages early sign-ups and beta access. You get free marketing and build a digital presence.

Like I said, 10 bands is a lot without income already. I explain to my clients that you have to set reasonable expectations. People become interested when they can see the progress. We can create demo users and profiles for content until the actual users start signing up.

I have the complete transcript of this 46-minute conversation. I’ll send you bullet points—high-level and low-level tasks—so you don’t have to circle back. We break it down into phases. Phase 1: MVP. We’ll integrate Stripe or PayPal. You mentioned SoFi or BlueVine for the backend—we’ll integrate those for affiliations so you’re making money on the backend too.

Phoenix: I’m grateful for your mind.

Dame: Realistically, if we were to kick into a "Sprint," what type of budget could you do for a 7-day blitz to get to a launch?

Phoenix: Most of my bread has been invested in the corporation and trademarks. In January and February, I'll have more.

Dame: My suggestion: I’ll send you a list of phases. We can start with "5 to a stack" ($500 - $1,000) just to build it out, with the understanding that we revisit the rest in February. I believe in my word. I’ll start on the domain, the SEO, and the perimeter security via Cloudflare. I’d rather present something to you that makes you say "Wow" so you know how we move forward.

Phoenix: Perfect. I’ll send you a brief of everything I’m telling you so we can move forward in steps.

Dame: I'll get that summary together in 10 to 15 minutes. Text me your email. Let's begin knocking it out.

Phoenix: I appreciate you.

Dame: All right, bro. Peace.
